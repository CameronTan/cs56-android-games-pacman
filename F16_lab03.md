1 This project is Pac Man for the Android platform. The objective is to eat all the pellets without getting caught by the ghosts.

2 As a user I can start a new game, look at the instructions, play a new game. As a user I can swipe in a direction to change the direction of my character so that I can eat pellets and avoid ghosts.

3 The software does work. This is a game where the user swipes up,down,left,right to control the central avatar, PacMan, so that he can eat pellets.

4 As a user I would like an option to better pause the game or a more explicit way to pause. As a user I would also like the option for multiple ghosts to be on the screen at the time. As a user, I would like to be able to customize my pacman so it’s not the same boring character. As a user, I would like there to be fruits (like in the original pacman game) for bonus points. As a user, I would like to make it more challenging by setting a timer for PacMan. If he does not collect the pellets by the time the timer runs out, he loses, regardless if he does not get caught by a ghost or not.

5 What would be helpful is to identify more user stories so future generations know what to improve on. Otherwise, the README.md is in great condition and provides an excellent point to start developing, especially if you have not had any android application experience before.

6 No build.xml since it is an android project. There is nothing in the gradle file either.

7 There are enough issues for 1000 points. The issues are mostly affecting the user and do not deal much with the code.

8 The rendering on the walls is not always correct, sometimes you cannot see one of the walls.

9 There are 16 java files that are used to create different parts of the game. Although some file names are a bit vague when knowing what its code is supposed to do, reading the comments that past generations have left behind make the code much more understandable. Once reading the messages left behind, some of the code becomes clearer. My partner and I have not been exposed to programming an Android application, and any code that involves importing android libraries and “packages” are a relatively new concept for us. If we were able to give a screenful of text to the next programmer for this project, it would contain all the original 16 java file names followed by a very clear description of what each file was supposed to do and what kind of classes should be included into the file. In addition, we would include the link to the android in case they have never been exposed to it before. Lastly we would leave remarks about what still needs to be fixed in the game so that the future programmers know what is missing in the code.

10 There are no test cases other than ExampleUnitTest and ApplicationTest. ApplicationTest is used to make sure that the app is running. On the other hand, I believe most of our tests will be through the application, by seeing if it works or not. Although we could expand test coverage by writing the test files ourselves and running them through a prompt, we believe testing the code through the application itself is the best way to understand the problem.
