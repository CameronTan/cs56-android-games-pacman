#### A) SUMMARY

Replicating the pacman arcade game on android.  The game features a yellow cheese wedge that navigates through a maze evading deadly AI-controlled ghosts and consuming small white dots.

#### B) USER STORIES

* As a user I can see the Title screen before the game begins.
* As a user, I have the option to click on three buttons on the screen (New Game, Settings, and How to Play) to make the game accessible to new players without annoying experienced players.
* As a user, I can click the new Game button that takes you to a screen with the map layout and pacman.
* As a user, I can click on the "How to Play" button that leads to the "How to play" screen.
* As a user, I can move pacman around by swiping in the direction I wish to go.
* As a user, I can have Pacman eat the pellets as he approaches them.
* As a user, I can KILL Pacman (inadvertently) by allowing him to be intercepted by a ghost.
* As a user, I can pause the game.
* As a user, I can view the High Score and Current Score at the top of the screen during the game.
* As a user, I can make pacman eat the pellets to increase the current score.
* As a user, I can know if I've surpassed the current high score by being notified when the current score surpasses the high score.
* As a user, I can hear background music that starts and stops appropriately.


#### C) SOFTWARE RUNTIME ASSESSMENT

In order to run the program in its current state, it required the use of an android emulator via Android Studio.  The game commences with the "Run" command (Shift + F10 on Windows and Linux).  Following our first attempt at this, the software ran correctly and matched the functionality described in the user stories above.  It replicated the Pacman arcade game almost exactly, save for the ghost AI (which currently sit stationary at a predetermined spot in the maze and do not move).

#### D) POTENTIAL USER STORIES

* As a user, I can watch ghosts controlled via AI move towards Pacman so that I know to avoid them.
* As a user, I can identify different personalities in different ghosts so plan my playstyle accordingly.
* As a user, I can implement a mute button which mutes music, sound effects, and any other sounds the game may produce.

#### E) README QUALITY ASSESSMENT

There are several aspects of the README.md file which could be improved to assist future coders working on this project.  First and foremost, user stories should always be consistent; however, upon evaluating the README.md file we found discrepancies about which features of the code had been added.  There were conflicting user stories regarding the mute button and ghost animations, specifically.  Furthermore, the layout of the README was messy, and finished user stories should have been listed in a separate category.  Instead, they were crossed out and not ordered in any particular way.

#### F) BUILD.XML QUALITY ASSESSMENT

There was no build.xml file in the repo we cloned, so we don't have any analysis to provide on that.  Rather, there is a build.gradle, the Android equivalent of a build.xml.  It was clean and had all the relevant targets, but it contained no legacy JWS code.

#### G) CURRENT ISSUES ASSESSMENT

Current issues mostly include glitchy ghost AI whose implementation was attempted but never fully finished.  This is a sizeable amount of points (200).  Additionally preferences set by the player do not save.  This has an unspecified point value.  Utimately, there seem to be roughly 500 points at stake for both unresolved issues and potential user stories.

#### H) ADDITONAL ISSUES

The major additional issue we would add is to refactor code, especially in DrawingView.java, to make it more object-oriented.

#### I) CODE ASSESSMENT

The code is messy and not structured very well.  As previous designers have noted, the code needs to be refactored to be more object-oriented since we're dealing with pacman and ghost objects.  Since the code hasn't been refactored, a lot of our files, especially DrawingView.java, are overly bloated and long.  It's therefore difficult to see how the classes relate to one another since there are very few member functions.  If we were to give one piece of advice to a new programmer, we'd highly recommend the android tutorial.  It appears to be a more helpful tool to analyze the class structure of the program than the code itself.

#### J) TEST QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Test coverage is nonexistent.  A test file does exist, but it contains a meaningless test function that asserts an obvious mathematical statement.  There appears to have never been a single test function at any stage of the development of this game.  Yet, we have identified many aspects of the game that could be tested individually.  In particular, testing the spawning of different ghosts, pacman, and dots, as well as testing the movement of the AI.  There are many complicated processes at work during the game that could make testing difficult when running the game all at once, since an error being produced could have nothing to do with what you want to test.
