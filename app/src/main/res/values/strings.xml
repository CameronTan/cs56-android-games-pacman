    <string name="howToPlay">Pacman, our hero, munches his way around the room, eating all of the
        Pac-dots. However, life isn't easy for our young little hero. Along his journey, he faces
        spooky Ghosts who will try to harm him. Avoid them at all costs. In each corner of the room
        there is a "Power Pellet." When Pacman eats one, the Ghosts turn blue and Pacman
        will be able to temporarily eat them as well.
